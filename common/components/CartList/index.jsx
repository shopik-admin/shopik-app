 * picking screen, the ops view and the order products list all render through it,
 * so they cannot look different from one another.
 *
 * `entries` comes from groupCart and is rendered in the order given — a screen that
 * groups its own view (the pick tabs) passes its own order. `onItemClick` is only
 * passed by the screens that can work on a product.
